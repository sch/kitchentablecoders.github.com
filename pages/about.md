    Amit is a coder and designer. Formerly a professional musician, his work to date
spans across experimental art, research, education, and entrepreneurial
projects. A recurring theme in Amit’s work is the extreme attention to
user-experience, specifically how technology can promote (or destroy) curiosity,
literacy, and creativity.

    As an educator, Amit develops curricula that focus on the coupling of technology
and the creative thought process. He taught at New York University’s ITP and
Cooper Union’s Arts department. Interested in alternative education
environments, Amit is also the co founder of Kitchen Table Coders, hosting
intimate workshops/salons for people who are eager to expand their love for
coding.
