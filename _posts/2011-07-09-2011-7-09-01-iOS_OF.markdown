This week we'll take a closer look at how we can integrate XCode's
Interface Builder with OpenFrameworks apps, and take advantage of
Apple's native UI elements in our creative apps.

You should come with basic experience in writing OpenFramework
Applications, and preferably - at least one successful attempt to run
OF on your iPhone/iPad. A bit experience with Objective-C can be
helpful but not crucial (we'll cover some of it ourselves).

Please have XCode 3.2 (preferred) or 4.0 installed on your machine, as
well as the iOS SDK. If you'd like to test your app on the device,
you'll need to obtain the $100 developer license from Apple. Otherwise
you'll still be able to compile the app to the simulator, but not the
device.

Lastly, please be sure to download the iPhone OpenFrameworks release:

(Save As)
