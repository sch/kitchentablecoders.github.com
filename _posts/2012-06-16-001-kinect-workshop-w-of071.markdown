Instructor: Jeff Crouse <a href="http://www.jeffcrouse.info">www.jeffcrouse.info</a>

This workshop will provide an introduction to creating interactive software with the Kinect, a $140 consumer depth+RGB camera that provides some of the same functionality as professional hardware that can cost many times more.  We will learn skeleton tracking, player masking, and accessing depth measurements. These techniques allow us to create simple apps that make use of whole-body interaction.

We will use the newly released Microsoft Kinect SDK Version 1.5 to access the device, openFrameworks 0071 to create the apps, and the ofxKinectNui addon as the bridge between the two.

Kinect cameras will be provided if you do not have your own.  I will distribute the addon and some sample apps at the beginning of the workshop.
