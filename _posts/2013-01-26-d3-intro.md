D3 is a framework for declarative data visualization in JavaScript, used by sites such as nytimes.com to make beautiful data-driven graphics for the web. While not a general-purpose graphics tool, it excels in revealing relationships between data and diagrams by embracing the browser's existing support for Javascript, CSS, and SVG. This workshop will guide you through D3's potentially abstruse minutia by providing a dataset and touching on all the essentials to create elegant, web-worthy visualizations.

Prerequisites: Intermediate programmer comfortable with JavaScript
