Node.js is a young yet promising project for writing server-side
JavaScript. In this workshop we'll build a basic Node.js server on our
laptops and use WebSockets to build a simple realtime multiuser
graphical environment.

As Node.js lends itself particularly well to a functional style of
programming, we'll take the opportunity to introduce basic functional
programming. Finally, we'll discuss some of the unique advantages of
the NodeJS event-based model as well as its current limitations.

This workshop assumes you have basic familiarity with at least one
programming language.

In order to allow us more time to code, we kindly ask that you have
Node.js installed on your laptop (you'll need to be running a local
server). On OSX, you can download this install package and just
double-click to install:<a
