**This is a 6 week workshop. Saturdays, noon-4pm, October 20-December
  1st (Except November 10)**

Have you been working with Processing or ActionScript, but need more
performance to realize your interactive project? Are you a JavaScript
hacker who'd like to add c++ to her arsenal of skills? If so, it's
probably time to make the jump to openFrameworks, an open source c++
toolkit for creative coding. OpenFrameworks is not only a very
powerful tool for creative coding, but a great way to enter the
sometimes daunting world of c++. For just a few examples of the type
of things that are possible with openFrameworks, check out the oF
gallery here.

This **6-week intensive** workshop is for coders who are already
familiar with object oriented programming concepts, but would like to
dive into openFrameworks. We will cover topics such as interfacing
with web services, intermediate-level oF/openGL classes, common
computer vision techniques, and working with addons. For a full list
of topics covered, please see the agenda below.

Participants are encouraged (but not required) to come in with a
specific idea for a project they'd like to do. Each week, we will work
for 3 hours on covering new concepts, and then (time permitting) spend
the last hour working on individual projects.

*A word about prerequisites:* This is an intermediate level
 workshop. You must be comfortable with object oriented programming
 concepts to participate. If you aren't sure whether you are ready to
 take this workshop, please ask me. If you would like to take this
 workshop but aren't sure you meet the prerequisites, please contact
 me and let me know. If there is enough interest, I will run a 3 week
 "Introduction to Creative Coding with openFrameworks" workshop before
 this one.


#### Agenda This is is a rough outline of the topics that we will
cover in the workshop. I will try my best to get through every topic
listed here. However, at Kitchen Table Coders we keep wokshop sizes
very small so that we can personalize each one as much as possible. So
it may change over the course of the class based on interest and skill
level.

__Week 1: Oct 20 - Introduction__

* openFrameworks introduction
* basic drawing and colors
* ofImage vs ofTexture (what&rsquo;s the difference?)
* using vectors in 2D and 3D space
* ofTrueTypeFont, ofDirectory
* ofVideoGrabber, ofVideoPlayer
* the dreaded pointer
* arrays
* the &lsquo;new&rsquo; operator

__Week 2: Oct 27- openGL__

* matrix transformations
* ofMesh (ofVBO, ofVboMesh)
* ofCamera
* ofFbo
* ofShader

__Week 3: November 3 - Networking__

* ofxOSC (for communicating between machines)
* ofURLFileLoader
* interfacing with web services (REST, JSON)
* Flickr, Twitter, YouTube
* basic regular expressions
* calling command line programs from within oF

__Week 4: November 17 - Computer Vision__
* sifting through pixels
* isolate a single color in video input
* background subtraction
* blob detection
* blob tracking

__Week 5: November 24: Box2D__

[Box2D](http://vimeo.com/26747704) is a powerful physics library that
will allow you to have realistic-looking reactions and behaviors
within your app. If you are interested in making a 2D game, this
library is for you.

__Week 6: December 1: Addons__
* finding addons
* using addons (I'll take suggestions here)
* creating addons


 
# About Kitchen Table Coders:
 
Hi, we're David, Amit, Ted, Tims & Jeff. We design software & hardware
for a living and share a studio in Brooklyn. We're ever curious about
new and old languages, as well as the people who shaped
them. Sometimes we teach graduate courses, so we figured why not do
informal workshops at our studio with like-minded folk.  Every week we
host a workshop on a topic we're passionate about. We keep it down to
6 people because that's how many fit around our kitchen table. There's
no projector. We just hang out for the day, and enjoy a collaborative
learning experience.  Check out our previous workshops or more info!
