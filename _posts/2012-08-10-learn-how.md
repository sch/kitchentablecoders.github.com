Computer programming is the designing and writing of source code for
computer software; code is the building block for every piece of
technology around us. A growing, coordinated effort to build "code
literacy" has gained momentum in recent years with the launch of
numerous local workshops and free online programs aimed to teach
anyone any kind of programming language. All this activity has raised
important questions concerning how we interact with our increasingly
programmed world.

This August, Rhizome is pleased to host Kitchen Table Coders Presents:
Learn to Code from an Artist. This is a two-part event: the first part
is a panel discussion, the second is a workshop exploring the practice
of teaching and utilizing code in an artistic context. The event will
take place over the course of two days in the New Museum Theater.

In this first event, the Kitchen Table Coders will present their
teaching philosophy and methodology, which emphasizes collaborative
learning experiences by blurring the line between student and teacher,
and will discuss the issues and trends in code and computer literacy
in the arts with a panel of educators and artists in the
field. Panelist include Amit Pitaru of Kitchen Table Coders; Jer
Thorpe, artist and educator; Sonali Sridhar of Hacker School; and
moderated by Douglas Rushkoff, educator and author of Program or Be
Programmed: Ten Commands for a Digital Age

The following day, small Kitchen Table Coders-style workshops, hosted
by artists working with code, will provide a gentle introduction to
the basics of code and programming. Space is limited and seats are on
a first-come, first-served basis.

The Kitchen Table Coders are Amit Pitaru, David Nolan, Jeff Crouse,
and Ted Hayes - a group of professional programmers with a passion for
knowledge sharing, began to host small workshops around a kitchen
table in their Brooklyn studio space. Open to anyone interested in
learning code, the Kitchen Table Coders keep their workshop classes
small to create personalized and collaborative learning
experiences. kitchentablecoders.com

Organized by Rhizome, the New Silent Series receives major support
from The Rockefeller Foundation, and The Andy Warhol Foundation for
the Visual Arts. Additional support is provided by the New York City
Department of Cultural Affairs, and the New York State Council on the
Arts.
