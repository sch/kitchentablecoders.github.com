For a programming language less than two years old, CoffeeScript has
created a lot of buzz and deservedly so. CoffeeScript takes some of
the best ideas from languages like Ruby and Python, adds its own
flairs, and yet stays true to the soul JavaScript. In this class we'll
cover the essence of CoffeeScript as well as how to leverage it for
client-side development and basic server-side development with
Node.js. This class assumes intermediate experience with at least one
other object oriented programming language.

*Prerequisites:* Web browser.
