Waiting for your code to compile sucks why not write code and change your program while it's running?  The quick feedback of live coding is an enormous boon to learning and creating, and we'll explore some ways of doing so by writing live Processing sketches in a new programming language called Clojure that works on some old and important ideas.  We'll also talk about live coding parallels in dataflow environments such as PureData, their implications on artistic expression and performance, and learn how to create generative visual works with clean, elegant code.

No previous programming knowledge required only an open mind and quick fingers.
