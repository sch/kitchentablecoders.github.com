We'll spend Sunday afternoon building our own drawing software with
OpenFrameworks.
 
The first part of the day will be dedicated to a bit of C++
foundation. We'll touch on the basic and relevant aspects of C++ that
can serve us well for creative prototyping.
 
Next, we'll start coding a simple drawing program and get familiar
OF's drawing API and Mouse/Key events. We'll slowly expand our
programs to include more of what OF has to offer.
