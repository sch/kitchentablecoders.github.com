Once maligned by nearly everyone, JavaScript has now amassed an
incredible number of devoted fans and practitioners. And why not?
JavaScript is the at the heart of where the web is going and projects
like Node.js are determined to expand JavaScript beyond clients.

One fascinating side-effect of JavaScript's popularity is that
functional programming concepts, previously academic curiosities, are
now going mainstream. This class explores the idea of first class
functions, closures, map, reduce, filter, and a whole host of other
incredibly useful tricks from the perspective of JavaScript. If you
think objects are fun, you'll leave this class with a whole new set of
approaches to consider in your projects.

This class is intended for people who have intermediate to advanced
experienced in at least one other programming language.

*Prerequisites:* Web browser.
