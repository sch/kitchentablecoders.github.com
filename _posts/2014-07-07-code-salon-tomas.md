###Language-integrated data with type providers

The world of data speaks a different language than the world of programming languages. On one side, we have REST, schema, micro-formats, JSON or RDF, but on the other side we have just types and classes. This mismatch makes it hard to access data from languages and especially from statically typed ones. I'll show how F# type providers bridge this gab. I'll cover accessing data from WorldBank and Freebase services, as well as JSON, XML and CSV documents.
 
In the talk and the follow-up discussion, I'd like to combine programming language theory (what type providers mean for the type system), practical programming (live coding to access interesting data) and the big picture (how type providers changed my view of the world).

Tomas is a computer scientist, book author and open-source developer. He is the lead developer of several F# data-science libraries, but he also contributed to the design of the F# language itself as an intern and independent contractor. He is finishing a PhD at the University of Cambridge, working on types for understanding context usage in programming languages. Tomas also likes to combine theory with practice and has been doing part-time F# consulting and training in the last few years.
