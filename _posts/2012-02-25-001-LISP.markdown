The construction of computer programs represents an entirely new
form of writing. While we must sacrifice much of the linguistic
ambiguity found in traditional writing, we still somehow have to
create dynamic and flexible processes. In this experimental workshop
we will consider our craft from a variety of novel angles - one
radical approach we will take is using Clojure as the shared
language of understanding. By using an unfamiliar languge we can
drive at the essence of our art - the design of processes. But don't
come thinking you'll learn about the ins and outs of Clojure - in
the tradition of The Little Schemer we'll be using the most minimal
subset of the language necessary in order to focus on the
process of writing processes.

This workshop is free and seating is limited. Bring your laptop and
bring an open mind. The workshop will be extremely discussion
oriented and you are expected to lead the conversation just as much
as we do. The workshop is designed for intermediate to advanced
programmers.
