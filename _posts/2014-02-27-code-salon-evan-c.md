### Taxonomy of FRP

Functional Reactive Programming (FRP) is becoming an increasingly common way to structure event-driven code, but this term "FRP" actually refers to a large body of increasingly diverse work. This talk will quickly cover the basics of FRP, and then go into a couple different formulations of FRP that people are using. We will explore how these formulations fit together historically and theoretically. Finally, we will see how this plays out in the theory and implementation of FRP in Elm.  

_About Evan_

Evan is the designer and developer of Elm, a purely functional programming language for web programming. He works at Prezi improving Elm's compiler, tools, community, and learning resources to make the language a great choice for industrial use. He previously worked at Google, programming gmail servers in C++ and learning precisely when ontologies and machine learning are not your friend.
