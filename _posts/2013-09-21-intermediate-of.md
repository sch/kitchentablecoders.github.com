####This is a 6 week workshop. Saturdays, 1pm-5pm, September
    21-October 26th

Have you been working with Processing or ActionScript, but need more
performance to realize your interactive project? Are you a JavaScript
hacker who'd like to add c++ to her arsenal of skills? If so, it's
probably time to make the jump to
[openFrameworks](http://www.openframeworks.cc), an open source c++
toolkit for creative coding. OpenFrameworks is not only a very
powerful tool for creative coding, but a great way to enter the
sometimes daunting world of c++. For just a few examples of the type
of things that are possible with openFrameworks, check out the oF
gallery here.

This *6-week intensive* workshop is for coders who are already
familiar with object oriented programming concepts, but would like to
dive into openFrameworks. We will cover topics such as interfacing
with web services, intermediate-level oF/openGL classes, common
computer vision techniques, and working with addons. For a full list
of topics covered, please see the agenda below.

Participants are encouraged (but not required) to come in with a
specific idea for a project they'd like to do. Each week, we will work
for 3 hours on covering new concepts, and then (time permitting) spend
the last hour working on individual projects. Additional
"studio/office hours" for working on and getting assitance with
projects can be arranged for a nominal fee.

###Prerequisites

This is an *intermediate level* workshop. You must be comfortable with
object oriented programming concepts to participate. If you aren't
sure whether you are ready to take this workshop, please ask me. If
you would like to take this workshop but aren't sure you meet the
prerequisites, please contact me and let me know. If there is enough
interest, I will run a 3 week "Introduction to Creative Coding with
openFrameworks" workshop before this one, or we can arrange one-on-one
tutoring to prepare you for this workshop.

_IMPORTANT_ Participants should
[download and install openFrameworks](http://www.openframeworks.cc/download/)
(and appropriate IDE) and run all examples in the "examples" folder
before the first workshop. If you need help with either of these
steps, please contact us.</p>

###Agenda

This is is a rough outline of the topics that we will cover in the
workshop. I will try my best to get through every topic listed
here. However, at Kitchen Table Coders we keep wokshop sizes very
small so that we can personalize each one as much as possible. So it
may change over the course of the class based on interest and skill
level.

### Week 1: Sept 21 - Introduction

* openFrameworks introduction
* basic drawing and colors
* ofImage vs ofTexture (what's the difference?)
* using vectors in 2D and 3D space
* noise
* ofTrueTypeFont, ofDirectory
* ofVideoGrabber, ofVideoPlayer
* Finding/Using addons

### Week 2: Sept 28- openGL

* matrix transformations
* ofMesh (ofVBO, ofVboMesh)
* ofCamera
* ofFbo
* ofShader


### Week 3: October 5 - Networking/Web

*
  [ofxLibWebSockets](https://github.com/labatrockwell/ofxLibwebsockets)
* ofURLFileLoader
* interfacing with web services (REST, JSON)
* Flickr, Twitter, YouTube, EchoNest, Awesomium
* basic regular expressions
* calling command line programs from within oF


### Week 4: October 12 - Computer Vision

* sifting through pixels
* isolate a single color in video input
* background subtraction
* blob detection
* blob tracking
* Kinect


### Week 5: October 19: c++ &amp;&amp; Memory

* References
* Pointers
* Passing by pointer vs pass by reference
* Constructors
* the "new" operator


### Week 6: October 26: Buffer Week

This week will either be used to cover stuff we didn't get to in the
previous weeks, or any topic that the participants wish to cover. Last
year, we did a basic Unity introduction and some additional Kinect
lessons. Oher potential topics could be iOS development, physics
simulators, or just about any other addon that you can find at
[ofxAddons](http://www.ofxaddons.com).

Please contact us with any questions/concerns/suggestions.
