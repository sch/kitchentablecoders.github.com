With Amit Pitaru (http://pitaru.com , http://sws.cc , http://rhondaforever.com, htto://plantly.com)

A gentle introduction to the very fundamentals of coding, tailored espeially for data visualization poeple. We'll examine how to load a data file into Processing, parse it into visual elements, and create a simple interface to explore its story.

We'll be using the http://processing.org platform, so please download the latest version from the site (http://processing.org/download)
