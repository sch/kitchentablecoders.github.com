Kitchen Table Coders are excited to announce "The Immutable Stack", a full day of training on Clojure, Datomic, ClojureScript, and Om. We believe the immutable stack is a game changer for architecting robust, modern applications.

The goal of the class is to give students hands-on experience building a real end-to-end immutable app, and to have them leave prepared to exercise those skills in the wild. With this training, we aim to replicate the same small hands-on experience that is a signature of our workshops while at the same time going much, much further in depth. 

Only a basic understanding of Clojure is required.

The following is a rough outline of the material we expect to cover:

> Backend
>>The Database: Datomic
>>>Schemas <br>
>>>Datomic Datalog <br>
>>>Transactions <br>
>>>Deployment
>>The API: Ring / Jetty
>>>Middleware <br>
>>>Live development <br>
>>>Deployment

>Frontend
>>Developing ClojureScript Apps
>>>ClojureScript <br>
>>>Google Closure <br>
>>>lein-cljsbuild configuration <br>
>>>Source maps & debugging
>>Applicaion State: UI as EDN
>>>Introduction to Om <br>
>>>Reusable components <br>
>>>Undo / Redo and Time Travel <br>
>>>Client / Server synchronization
