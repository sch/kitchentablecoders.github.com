Node.js gives creative developers the ability to quickly prototype and
create real-time multi-user experiences.

In this workshop we'll build a basic Node.js server on our laptops and
use WebSockets to build a simple realtime multiuser graphical
environment in a web browser. However we won't stop there, we'll show
you how to hook up sensors and electronics to create physical controls
for multiplayer Pong!

In order to allow us more time to code, we kindly ask that you arrive
with Node.js installed on your laptop (you'll need to be running a
local server). You can find installers for your operating system here,

*Prerequisites:* This workshop assumes you have basic familiarity with
at least one programming language.
