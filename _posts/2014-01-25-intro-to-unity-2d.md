### Description

The popular Unity3D engine has recently added native support for 2D
graphics, which has the potential to turn the world of 2D games upside
down. You no longer have to create 3D models or manage a 3D world to
use this powerful tool. Exciting 2D games for web, desktop, or mobile
platforms are easier to make than ever without sacrificing Unity's
incredible workflow. Anyone interested in developing these kinds of
games should become familiar with it.

This four hour workshop will cover the basics of Unity and focus on
its new 2D features. Towards the end of the workshop, we'll build a
simple game together.

- Basics of Unity
- Differences with Unity3D
- Importing Assets
- Animation Curves
- Animation with Sprite Sheets
- Animation States
- Layers
- Physics
- Cameras
- Particle Systems

### Prerequisites

Familiarity with some kind of programming language is a must,
experience with Unity 3D is preferred.

Please be sure to have the latest version of Unity installed
