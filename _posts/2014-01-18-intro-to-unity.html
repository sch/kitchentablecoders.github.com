<p><a href="http://unity3d.com/">Unity3D</a>&nbsp;is&nbsp;a high performance game engine that supports&nbsp;<a href="http://unity3d.com/unity/multiplatform">tons of platforms</a>, including MacOS, Windows, iOS, Android, web plugin, PS3, XBox, and Wii. &nbsp;It also features the <a href="http://unity3d.com/unity/quality/physics">PhysX physics engine</a>, a full animation system, FMOD for spatialized audio, and a pretty nice asset market, too! &nbsp;All wrapped in an easy to use interface.</p>
<p>This 4 hour workshop will cover the following:</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Creating basic GameObjects</span></li>
<li><span>Prefabs</span></li>
<li><span>Using the built in physics engine (RigidBody, Colliders)</span></li>
<li><span>Importing 3D models and other assets</span></li>
<li><span>Basic scripting using both JavaScript and C#</span></li>
<li><span>Animating using the Animation interface</span></li>
<li><span>Particle systems</span></li>
<li>3D Audio effects</li>
<li><span>Camera effects, Skyboxes, Lighting</span></li>
<li><span>Character Controller</span></li>
</ol>
<p>Unity is a commercial game engine, but there is <a href="http://unity3d.com/unity/download">a free version</a> available with most of the features of the commercial version. If you'd like to participate, I recommend downloading and installing before coming to the workshop.</p>

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
For the scripting section of the workshop, you should have some familiarity with some kind of programming language.
