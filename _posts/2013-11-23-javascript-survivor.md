### Description

We could all use some JavaScript survival skills in a pinch. This
class will show you how to write clean client side JavaScript using
jQuery, Underscore and JavaScript Templates. We'll emphasize good
functional style to manage code complexity. We'll also cover how to
use browser based developer tools effectively and demonstrate useful
approaches for cross browser testing (shakes fist at Internet
Explorer). Expect to leave the class with adequate tools to write
JavaScript fearlessly when backed into a corner.

### Prerequisites

You should be familiar with at least one other programming language
and have passing familiarity with JavaScript.
