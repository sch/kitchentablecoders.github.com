# Kitchen Table Coders' Workshop

## Introduction

This repo holds the code for Kitchen Table Coder's **AI Atelier** website. The
site is written in Jekyll and hosted on Github Pages.

You'll need [ruby](https://github.com/postmodern/chruby) configured on your
system to build the site locally. Run `bin/server` to install dependencies and
start an incremental build server. Navigate to
[localhost:4000](http://127.0.0.1:4000) to view the site.

## CSS

The site reads from `assets/css/main.scss`. Jekyll will take a look at the file
name and render css from the Sass source.
