We'll spend Saturday afternoon learning how to use OpenFrameworks (OF)
to create iOS apps. We'll start with a general intro to OF, and then
dive specifically into exporting apps for iOS devices. We'll then take
a look at some of the specific features that OF has for iOS
(multitouch, accelorometor, etc.), as we go over OF example apps, as
well as write out own app.

Basic knowledge with OpenFrameworks or C++ is recommended (otherwise,
proficiency with Processing or Actionscript is also OK).

You'll need an Apple Developer iOS license ($100).  Once you have
that, please be sure to have xcode version 3.2.x installed on your mac
(note that xcode 4 might have issues with OpenFrameworks). You can
find a download of this older version on the Apple developer site,
once you have the developers license.

Lastly, please be sure to download the iPhone OpenFrameworks release:
